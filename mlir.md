# Brief on MLIR

MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) is a compiler infrastructure project that aims to provide a common framework for developing machine learning compilers and optimizing compilers. It was initiated by Google and has gained traction in the machine learning and compiler communities. Here is a brief history of MLIR:

1. **Project Initiation (2018)**:
   - MLIR was initially introduced as part of the TensorFlow project, an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. The need for a more flexible and extensible compiler infrastructure became apparent as TensorFlow grew.

2. **Open Sourcing (April 2019)**:
   - In April 2019, Google open-sourced MLIR, making it available to the broader community. The project was placed under the LLVM umbrella, which is known for its high-quality compiler technology.

3. **Goals and Design (2019 - Present)**:
   - MLIR was designed with several key goals in mind:
     - To provide a common infrastructure for machine learning compilers: MLIR aims to facilitate the development of machine learning compilers by offering a unified framework that can be reused across projects.
     - To support various programming languages and hardware targets: MLIR is designed to be versatile and capable of handling a wide range of languages and target platforms.
     - To enable advanced compiler optimization: MLIR's design allows for advanced compiler optimization passes and transformations, making it suitable for high-performance computing tasks.
     - To be modular and extensible: MLIR's architecture is modular, allowing developers to add custom dialects and passes tailored to their specific needs.
   
4. **Adoption and Growth (2019 - Present)**:
   - MLIR's adoption has been steadily growing in the machine learning and compiler communities. Several projects have started to incorporate MLIR as a core component of their compiler infrastructure.
   - TensorFlow adopted MLIR as the foundation for its TensorFlow MLIR (TfLite) compiler, which is designed to optimize machine learning models for deployment on various hardware platforms.
   - Other machine learning frameworks and projects, such as XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) and ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange), have also expressed interest in integrating MLIR.

5. **Development and Community Involvement (Ongoing)**:
   - MLIR development is ongoing, with contributions from various organizations and individuals in the open-source community.
   - The MLIR community actively collaborates on design, development, and documentation to make MLIR a robust and widely adopted compiler infrastructure.

In summary, MLIR was born out of the need for a more versatile and extensible compiler infrastructure in the machine learning and compiler domains. It has evolved into an open-source project with a growing community and is poised to play a significant role in optimizing and compiling machine learning models for a wide range of hardware targets.
